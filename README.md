# The Shady Market
In the particularly shady regions of the Summer Court, below the treetop palace of the Emerald Woods, the Shady Market was established.  Forged from Blanca's dream in the fires of passion from Agdon, this market spans beyond the Feywild into many of the well-known hospitable planes.

## The Muckroot Trade Warren
Located in Hither, a subdomain of the Feywild, this trade post boasts fantastic history and beautiful decor. 
Carved from the stump of the tree that nearly ended Agdon's career, it's a labor of spite and a show of the brigand's unrelenting force.
This makes it an incredibly popular stop for seedy planeswalkers.  

Status aside, this location's allure attracts a crowd, and a crowd means more to steal and more to trade.

# HOW TO USE
To use the tool, you can `$peruse` Blanca's goods.  Talk to your DM if there's an item you want.

Items rotate daily and are not unique to players, though some goodies may appear randomly.  There will always be 3 mundane items, 2 common items, and 1 uncommon item each week.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
